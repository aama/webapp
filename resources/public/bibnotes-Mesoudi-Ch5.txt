Notes - Ch 5

1. Fitch 2008; Whitfield 2008; Pagel 2009. 
2. The following history is taken from van Wyhe 2005. 
3. Darwin 1871, 90– 91.
4. Not to be confused with the phylogenetic comparative method in biology, which is used to test for correlated changes on a phylogenetic tree as was used in Holden and Mace’s 2003 study discussed in the previous chapter.
5. McMahon and McMahon 2003. 
6. See Gray, Greenhill, and Ross 2007 and Pagel 2009 for overviews. 
7. See Diamond and Bellwood 2003 for the express-train model as applied to several regions, including Southeast Asia, and Diamond 2000 on Austronesian languages. 
8. The Indonesian origin was suggested by Oppenheimer and Richards 2001; Terrell et al. 2001 argue that intergroup transmission prevents accurate historical reconstruction. 
9. Gray and Jordan 2000. 
10. Dixon 1997, 48. 
11. See Renfrew 1990 for details of these hypotheses. 
12. Gray and Atkinson 2003. 
13. Atkinson et al. 2008. 
14. Cited in Atkinson et al. 2008. 
15. Pagel, Atkinson, and Meade 2007. 
16. See Rubin 1995 for how memory biases can distort orally transmitted folktales.
17. Barbrook et al. 1998; Howe et al. 2001. 
18. The classic narrative account of the fall of the Roman Empire is Bury 1923, while modern accounts include Heather 2005. 
19. Turchin 2003, 2008. Note that the dynamical models discussed in this section have also been used in physics (e.g., mechanics) and chemistry (e.g., kinetics) as well as biology (e.g., population ecology). I focus here on the latter examples from population ecology because these are more applicable to human cultural change, given that both biological and cultural systems can be described as Darwinian (unlike physical and chemical systems).
20. In the interests of readability I will not include actual mathematical expressions for these functions. See Turchin 2003 for details. 
21. The following discussion is based on Turchin 2003. 
22. Collins 1995; see Turchin 2003, chapter 2. Note that for ease of exposition I have excluded “marchland position” from my discussion and illustration in the figure. However, Turchin shows that the conclusions remain the same if marchland position is considered.
23. Turchin 2003, chapter 2. Figure 5.2c is derived using Turchin’s equation 2.11, with c = 2 , h = 1 , and a = 1 . Starting points for empires 1, 2, and 3 are A = 2.2, 2.3, and 9.5 units, respectively. 
24. Following Ibn Khaldun, Turchin calls collective solidarity “asabiya.” I will use the more familiar term “cohesiveness.” 
25. Boyd and Richerson 1985, 2009. See also chapter 8. 
26. Tajfel 1982. 
27. Turchin 2003, figure 4.4. 
28. Turchin 2003, table 5.1. 
29. Fracchia and Lewontin 1999, 77– 78; see also Ingold 2007. 
30. Fracchia and Lewontin 1999, 77.
